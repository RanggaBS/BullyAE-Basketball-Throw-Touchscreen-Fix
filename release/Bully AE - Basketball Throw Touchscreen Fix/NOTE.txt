Anniversary Edition, allowing Jimmy to throw the ball into the hoop without the
need for a gamepad.

from the MSR "README.txt" file.

       /com.rockstargames.bully/files/BullyOrig/Scripts/MSR_II/"
    3. Open "GROUP_01_STC" or "GROUP_02_STC" folder and paste there.
       Doesn't matter which one you choose
    4. Rename the file you just pasted to "MOD_X.lur" and replace "X" with
